The siren sounded. Another 2 people went missing this time. The higher ups are worried. I couldn't sleep so I went outside and took a walk. As I walked around the grounds I saw some dark silhouettes coming, upon reflex I dodged behind a large rock and silently observed. From the voice I recognized that it’s the higher ups.
“Three people are missing now. What on earth are we going to tell the workers?”
“Nothing of course”
“Do you think that maybe it is ‘that’”
The second man turned to the first and faced him. From his tone I could tell that he was threatening. “And what would ‘that’ be?”
“Y-you know, t-the ‘thing’ that we uncovered”
“You shouldn’t poke into places that don’t concern you ‘Mr. Derek’”
Alex out."
